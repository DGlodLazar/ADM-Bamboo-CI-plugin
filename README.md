##Before you configure the connection

###  Configure ALM Octane shared space admin for an API access Client ID/Secret 
Ask the ALM Octane shared space admin for an API access Client ID and Client secret. The plugin uses these for authentication when
communicating with ALM Octane. The access keys must be assigned the CI/CD Integration role in all relevant workspaces. For details, see Set up API access for integration.
### Enable the CI server to communicate with ALM Octane
To enable the CI server to communicate with ALM Octane, make sure the server can access the Internet. If your network requires a proxy to
connect to the Internet, setup the required proxy configuration in Bamboo.
### Decide which Bamboo user ALM Octane will use to execute jobs on the server.
Caution: We strongly recommend setting this userâ€™s permissions to the minimum required for this integration: Job Build permissions.
